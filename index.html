<h1>Finally after lots of struggle, Williams Kindman is now a developer</h1>

<h2>A big thanks to EMORI & Pafrank for this one in a life time opportunity</h2>

<h3>I'm definitely going to be a good developer because I'm good at what I do & I'm the best of my kind.</h3>

<h4>I've always believed that No act of Kindness is ever wasted no matter how small.</h4>
<h5>You guys are making coding enjoyable that once seemed fearsome. I'm ready to run this race to the finish line. ðŸ’–</h5>
